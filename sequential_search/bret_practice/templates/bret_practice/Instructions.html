                In the following, you will see a {{ num_rows }} x {{ num_cols }} - matrix containing
                {{ num_boxes }} boxes on your screen.
            {% endblocktrans %}
        </p>
        <p>
            {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                As soon as you start the task by hitting the 'Start' button,
                one of the boxes is collected per second, starting from the top-left corner.
                Once collected, the box marked by a tick symbol.
                For each box collected you earn {{ box_value }}.
            {% endblocktrans %}
        </p>
        <p>
            {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                Behind one of the boxes hides a bomb that destroys everything that has been collected.
                The remaining {{ num_nobomb }} boxes are worth {{ box_value }} each.
                You do not know where the bomb is located.
                You only know that the bomb can be in any place with equal probability.
            {% endblocktrans %}

            {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                Your task is to choose when to stop the collecting process. You do so by hitting 'Stop' at any time.
                If you collect the box where the bomb is located, the bomb will explode and you will earn zero.
                If you stop before collecting the bomb, you gain the amount accumulated that far.

                At the end of the task boxes are toggled by hitting the 'Solve' button.
                A dollar sign or a fire symbol (for the bomb) will be shown on each of your collected boxes.

                You will first have a practice round before proceeding to the formal round. 
                You will only see whether you hit the bomb in the formal round, not the practice round. 
                Only your payoff from the formal round will count towards your final payoff.

            To understand this task, let us first consider two extreme cases:
            <br>If you collect 0 box, you will never hit the bomb but you will earn 0 point for sure.
            <br>you collect all the 100 boxes, you will definitely hit the bomb and your payment will also be 0.
            <br>So you would like to choose to collect some boxes between 0 and 100. 
            The more boxes you collect, the higher payment you can receive if you do not hit the bomb, 
            but with the higher chance you will hit the bomb (which lowers your payment to 0).
